# 2Take1Script Revive

#### I removed the code from the github repo because people apparently dont have enough IQ to go to [**releases**](https://github.com/DemonKiya/2Take1Script-Revive/releases) and instead download the code directly which causes issues..

2Take1Script Revive is the offical fix for the 2Take1Script, a script made by [**haekkzer**](https://github.com/haekkzer/) who discontinued it and allowed me to take it over

> Big Thanks to Wolfry, Proddy and haekkzer himself who teached me some stuff about lua and helped me with issues!
> 
> - Thanks to Kektram for (more or less) allowing me to steal 2 globals

## Setup

Download the latest script release from this git-repo [**here**](https://github.com/DemonKiya/2Take1Script-Revive/releases). The script comes in a `2Take1Script_Revive.zip` file.

Extract the `.zip` file in the `scripts` folder from the menu (see the [**Scripts Guide**](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/local/scripts) for further details).
If done right, your `scripts` folder should contain:

- `2Take1Script_Revive.lua` (main script)
- `2Take1Script_Revive\` (folder with additional assets)

Once all the above is done, you can straight go to [**Scripts**](https://gta.2take1.menu/features/local/scripts) and select **2Take1Script_Revive.lua**.

If you have a problem loading this script, have a look [**here**](#common-questions).

## Customize the Script

In order to customize the script, you have to edit the `2Take1Script_Revive\2Take1ScriptEXT.lua` file.

Although any text editor will do the work, I'd recommend a specialized code editor, such as **Notepad++**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Atom** or **Sublime Text**.

If you add something to a variable, set it to the last entry.

Here's an example:

```lua
-- This is RIGHT
local array = {
    {"Entry X", 10},
    {"Entry Y", 40},
    {"New Entry", -1},
}

-- This is WRONG
local array = {
    {"Entry X", 10},
    {"New Entry", -1},
    {"Entry Y", 40},
}
```

### Custom Script Events

Edit the `custom_script_events` global variable.

```lua
custom_script_events = {
    {"Custom Script Event 1", {
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
        {0xffffffff, {}},
    } },
    {"Custom Script Event 2", {
        {0xaaaaaaaa, {1, -1}},
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
    } },
}
```

### Attacker / Assassin PEDs

Edit the `ped_assassins` global variable. If you dont provide a weapon hash, the peds weapon will be a Combat MG Mk II

```lua
ped_assassins = {
--  {"Attacker Name", ped_Hash, ped_Type, weapon_Hash(optional)},
    {"Cop", 0x5E3DA4A4, 6, 0x1D073A89},
    {"FIB", 0x5CDEF405, 6, 0x2BE6766B},
    {"Juggernaut", 0x90EF5134, 4, 0x42BF8A85},
    {"Bigfoot", 0x61D4C771, 28},
}
```

### Punish Money Beggers

Edit the `begger_texts` global variable.

```lua
begger_texts = {
--  "Beg String 1", "Beg String 2, "Beg String 3", "...",
    "money please", "gib mal money hier", "any money dropper", "money dropper anyone?"
}
```

### License Plate Speedometer

Edit the `speedometer_units` global variable.

2Take1Script will convert from **meters per second** to the desired unit. Because of this, you need the **multiply factor** that will be applied in the conversion.

Don't forget to leave a blank space before the short name, otherwise the speed won't be displayed properly.

```lua
speedometer_units = {
--  {" Short Unit", mply_Factor, "Long Unit"},
    {" MPS", 1, "Meter per Second"},
    {" MPH", 2.23694, "Miles per Hour"},
    {" KMH", 3.6, "Kilometers per Hour"},
}
```

- The first unit, MPS, is the default unit, so it uses a multiplier of **1**.
- The third unit, KPH, equals **3.6** times the MPS unit (because 1 kph = 3.6 mps).

### Block Custom Areas

Edit the `block_custom` global variable.

The last line of each custom location will add a **Teleporting Position**.

Instead of setting a fixed position, you can place the objects at a random generated position.  
To do this, instead of typing the exact coordinates as shown above, use the following format:  
`{nil, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Z1, Z2}`

- `nil` defines that the coordinates will be randomly generated within a prism, whose vertices will be specified next.
- `X1` and `X2` define the range of coordinates for the X axis.
- `Y1` and `Y2` define the range of coordinates for the Y axis.
- `Z1` and `Z2` define the range of coordinates for the Z axis.

And always remember, **the first value has to be the smaller one**.

```lua
block_custom = {
--  {"Example", {
--      {hash, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, bool_Freeze, bool_Invisible},
--      {false, {teleport_Pos X, Y, Z}, float_Heading},
--      }, },
    {"Block Orbital Room", {
        {3291218330, {335.9567565918, 4834.3325195312, -58.686454772949}, {0, 0, 35}, true, true},
        {3291218330, {326.33291625977, 4827.6704101562, -60.25874710083}, {0, -90, 0}, true, true},
        {false, {342.8, 4838.2, -57}, 121.2},
        }, },
    {"Trees Main LSC", {
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {false, {-370.4, -104.72, 47}, -110.83449554443},
        }, },
}
```

### Custom Attachments

Edit the `custom_attachments` global variable.

Each attachment can be made of many entities; you only have to add more entity identifiers.

```lua
custom_attachments = {
--    {"Name", {
--      {hash, bone_ID, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, bool_Invisible},
--      }, },
    {"DEMI-GOD - Light", {
        {148511758, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, true},
        }, },
    {"DEMI-GOD - Heavy", {
        {148511758, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, -3.5}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, 3.5}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        }, },
    {"Cat Cap", {
        {0x573201B8, 119, {0, -0.075, 0.3}, {0, 0, 0}},
        }, },
}
```

The third example, "Cat Cap", uses a **ped hash**.

### New Custom Vehicles

Edit the `custom_vehicles` global variable.

This is the most complicated part of the Lua, but let's take it step by step.

1. The first line contains all **vehicle/object hashes** you want to use for the custom vehicle.
2. The next lines will define how each vehicle/object will be placed in the custom vehicle. You have to repeat this line for every hash you defined above. Keep in mind that the first of the hashes will define the **starting vehicle**.

- `hash`  
  This is the hash to which the next parameters will be applied.
- `{pos X, Y, Z}`  
  Set the offset of the entity.
- `{rot X, Y, Z}`  
  Set the rotation of the entity.
- `{primary_Color, secondary_Color, pearlescent, wheel, window}`  
  If the entity is a vehicle, set the primary/secondary/pearlescent/wheel color (all HEX RGB) and the window tint (0 to 3).
- `bool_Invisible`  
  Set this to `true` to render the entity invisible.
- `int_SpawnHeight`  
  If you have a plane as a starting vehicle, this value will let you spawn it at a certain amount of meters above the current location.
- `int_BoneIndex`  
  Set a boneindex if you want to attach something, for example, to the wheels.
- `int_AttachToEntity`  
  By default, everything will be attached to the first (starting) vehicle. To change that, just set it to the line number defining the vehicle where it should be attached.
- `ped_Hash`  
  To get the engine of a helicopter/plane running, you can set here a ped hash. The ped will be spawned into the vehicle, and the doors will be locked after it.
- `bool_NoCollision`  
  Set it to `true` to disable the collision for this entity.
- `int_Offset`  
  Defines how many meters away the entity should be spawned in front of you (especially for the preview).
- `int_OffsetZPreview`  
  Defines the height of the vehicle during the preview.
- `int_Alpha`  
  Some vehicles will glitch put if you render them invisible. Instead, set the Alpha to `0`.

The position/rotation *should* always be `nil` for the starting vehicle.

Setting some value to `nil` will set the default setting for it.  
For example, the color for each vehicle will be randomly selected.

Setting the starting vehicle's hash to `0` will check if you're in a vehicle and if the "Use own Vehicle" option is enabled.  
If that's the case, your current vehicle will become the "base", on which the rest of the entities will be attached.

```lua
custom_vehicles = {
--  {"Name", {
--      {hash1, hash2, hash3, ...}
--      {hash, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, {primary_Color, secondary_Color, pearlescent, wheel, window}, bool_Invisible, int_SpawnHeight, int_BoneIndex, int_AttachToEntity, ped_Hash, bool_NoCollision, int_Offset, int_OffsetZPreview, int_Alpha},
--      }, },
    {"WarMachine", {
        {0x9dae1398, 1030400667, 0x2F03547B, 2971578861, 3871829598, 3229200997, 0x187D938D, 782665360},
        {0x9dae1398, nil, nil, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, 15},
        {1030400667, {0, -4, 0}, nil, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}},
        {0x2F03547B, {0, -8, 4}, {-90, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, true, nil, nil, nil, 0x97F5FE8D, true},
        {2971578861, {-0.3, -0.6, 9.8}, {-90, 0, 0}, nil, nil, nil, 16, 3},
        }, },
    {"Attach Ramp", {
        {3233397978},
        {0},
        {3233397978, {0, 4.5, 0.25}, {0, 0, 180}},
        }, },
}
```

### Vehicle Spam

Edit the `vehicle_spam` global variable.

```lua
vehicle_spam = {
--  {"Name", Hash},
    {"Cargoplanes", 0x15F27762},
    {"Volatols", 0x1AAD0DED},
}
```

### SMS List

Edit the `sms_texts` global variable.

```lua
sms_texts = {
--  "Message 1", "Message 2", "Message 3", "..."
    "Fucking bitch", "REKT", "NOOB", "GET ON MY LEVEL", "Send Nudes", "UR MOM GAY"
}
```

### Load Weapons

Edit the `weapons` global variable.

```lua
weapons = {
--  {weapon_Hash, attachment1_Hash, attachment2_Hash, attachment3_Hash, ...},
    {0x1B06D571, 0xD7391086},
    {0x22D8FE39, 0x249A17D5, 0x359B7AAE, 0xC304849A, 0x9B76C72C},
    {0xCB96392F, 0xEFBF25, 0x420FD713, 0x27077CCB},
}
```

## Known Issues

- After disabling **2Take1Script-Parent**, you have to reload the script.
- Loading the script after using `Reset State` may result in the script activating features on it own, this is a lua api bug and cannot be fixed by me. Reinjecting the menu will temporarly fix it.
- Too many **Custom Vehicles / PEDs / Objects** may cause issues! Just delete them after use.
- Some features won't work properly if the distance between you and the target is too high.
- When the script gets autoloaded (for example, with an `autoexec.lua`), the **Event Listeners** (Chat features, etc) might not work.
- Teleport to Waypoint will teleport you near a street.
- Enabling Vehicle Colors might wont apply, press the Feature a few times.
- Rapid Fire doesnt work with the guided rocket launcher.

## Common Questions

> How do I add stuff?

- See [**Customize the Script**](#customize-the-script)

> How do I enter a Custom Vehicle?

- Enable **Spawn in Vehicle** under **Settings**.

> Does it work with other scripts?

- It should work - it has been tested with a few other scripts. But i dont officially support co-loads.

> Does it work after a GTA Update?

- Chances are very high for all **Script Event** features to break; everything else *should* be fine.

> Does it work after a 2T1 Update?

- Yes, under normal circumstances.

> How do I reset the script config?

- Delete the  `2Take1Script.ini` file in the  `2Take1Script_Revive\Config` folder.

> My game crashed when i load the script?

- Delete the  `2Take1Script.ini` file in the  `2Take1Script_Revive\Config` folder.

> I dont see the Script in the menu?

- Press "Refresh Scripts"

> The kick/Crash from the script did not work on a player?

- The Kick and Crash mostly only works on normal Players. Modder with a good Menu will most likely block it.

> I downloaded the new version, but i dont see the new features?

- Clear the cache of the Browser and make sure you deleted every old file.

> I dont see the Online-Player Features?

- They are not in Local -\> Script Features located. Go to the Online Tab and select a Player. Under Script Features you will see the Features.
