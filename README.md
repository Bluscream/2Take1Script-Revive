# 2Take1Script

The successor of [**haekkzers 2Take1Script**](https://github.com/haekkzer/2Take1Script)

**I removed the code from the github repo because people apparently dont have enough IQ to go to [**releases**](https://github.com/DemonKiya/2Take1Script-Revive/releases) and instead download the code directly which causes issues..**

> Big Thanks Proddy and haekkzer himself who teached me some stuff about lua and helped me with issues!
>
> Thanks to Barbiehunter for helping me with my tests
